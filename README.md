# Highway Traffic Control System

This project is a simulation of highway scenarios, where multiple vehicles join and leave the traffic at different times.

The twist is that these vehicles are all controlled by a centralized puppetmaster, which makes sure that every vehicle
reaches its destination safely while also trying to maintain the preferred speed of each and every vehicle.
